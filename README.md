ChatTriggers Module that I am working on for fun

## Current Features:
- A number of Chat Filters, mostly for useless dungeon messages. 
- Keyboard shortcuts for commands that I use frequently
  - Accessible in minecraft controls
  - No menu yet for adding your own, although that is something I would like to do
    in the future. If you are willing to help me on this, please reach out.
      - Adding your own is easy enough just by replicating code snippets
  - Party notifiers for terminal throttling
  - Cleanup for enchant and heart particles
    - Not yet toggleable either, but useful for enchant rune and healer hearts in dungeons.
  - A couple extra shortcut commands ripped from the code segment from bloom module.
    
 ## TO-DO: 
 - Hide Healer fairy
 - Toggles for everything
